#if (!file.exists("./data/household_power_consumption.zip")) {
#download.file(fileUrl1, destfile = "./data/household_power_consumption.zip")
#}
#hhpc <- read.table("data/household_power_consumption.txt",header=T,sep=";")
#hhpc <- read.table(unz("data/household_power_consumption.zip", "household_power_consumption.txt"),header=T,sep=";")
```
